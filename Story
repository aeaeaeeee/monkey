** Story: **
Once upon a time, there lived a monkey on the jamun tree by the banks of the river Ganges. 
The monkey wanted to make a cloth using a crocodile's skin. There was a crocodile nearby. He slowly
started to befriend the crocodile by feeding him the jamun berries, and slowly, they started poisoning
the berries.
